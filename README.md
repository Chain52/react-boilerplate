# React Boilerplate

This boilerplate is ready for use in a development environment. Production builds are not yet available but could be done through `react-scripts` if needed.
The code here is based on the https://www.reactboilerplate.com boilerplate code, but it does include some personal edits such as the use of pages, routing changes, and removing the server in favor of following a microservice approach in the future.

## Installation

- Install latest node.js: https://nodejs.org/.
- Install latest yarn package manager: https://yarnpkg.com/ (NPM is OK as well).
- Fork this repo and make adjustments to `package.json` to suit website.
- Install node modules with `yarn install` or `npm i`.
- Start the app with `yarn start` or `npm start`.
